# SwampCooler
CPE 301 Final project - Swamp Cooler

Team - Jacob Campau, Nick Campbell, Nathaniel Dulcero

<h2>Description</h2>
Create the components and code needed to build a swamp cooler. While the cicuit is not housed in its own swamp cooler, we were able to demonstrate an understanding of our CPE skills to create the idea of each component featured in a swamp cooler.

<h2>Work split</h2>
We all worked in person on multiple days. Due to the matter of our work, we did only one commit to submit the code when it was completed plus one additional fix. While in person we split the work into the following even sections:

- <b>Report and video: Jacob Campau</b> 
- <b>Circuit and schematics: Nathaniel Dulcero</b> 
- <b>Coding and internal circuit logic: Nick Campbell</b>

Note that these were not hard divisions of labor and we did all help each other on each of our sections when we could.
